Graph is a very common algorithm problem that you encounter in the coding interviews. However, this articile is not explaining the basic of graph theory. Instead, this article mainly disucssed about when the problem should be sovled by graph theories. Of course, some problems are very obvious that you were given a tree or graph to work on. But sometimes, it's not trival to identify whether the problem belong to graph. Therefore,  I will explain in details and use some classic problems to demonstrate my points in the following.


Firstly, if you were given an input of a matrix, there is a very high chance that you want to apply graph theory(dfs or bfs) to solve. Some of the classic problem are in LeetCode, e.g. [Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/), or [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/), or [Longest Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/).

Secondly, if you were given an input of a list of edge-like items (e.g [A,B] and A is source and B is destination) then you are required to build a graph using a hashtable and then apply graph theory to solve the corresponding problems. The examples for this are, [Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/), [Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/), or [Alien Dicitionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/).
