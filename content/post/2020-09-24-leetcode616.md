This description/problem statement could be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-bold-tag-in-string/). This question can be disected by three parts.In the following, I am going to dicuss in details with code on how to proceed in each part. 

The working solution is defined as followed
```python
class Solution:
    def addBoldTag(self, s: str, dict: List[str]) -> str:
        #STEP1
        intervals = []
        for word in dict:
            start = 0
            wordLength = len(word)
            startIndex = s.find(word, start)
            while startIndex != -1:
                intervals.append([startIndex, startIndex+wordLength-1])
                startIndex = s.find(word, startIndex+1)
        
        #STEP 2                 
        merged = []
        intervals.sort()
        print(intervals)
        for interval in intervals:
            if not merged or merged[-1][1] + 1 < interval[0]:
                merged.append(interval)
            else:
                merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1],interval[1])
        
        #STEP3
        result = ""
        prev = 0
        for interval in merged:
            result += (s[prev:interval[0]] + "<b>" + s[interval[0]: (interval[1]+1)] + "</b>")
            prev = interval[1]+1
        result += s[prev:]
        return result
```


**STEP 1 Find all the interval [wordStartIndex, wordEndIndex] that matches the dict word occurence in `s`.**

There could be two alternatives. 
* A. Use trie to store all the word first, and then we can treat every single character in `s` as starting point to do dfs traversal on the Trie.
* B. Use `string.find()` to find all occurences in the `s`.

For simplicity, we can use approach B.
```python
intervals = []
for word in dict:
    start = 0
    wordLength = len(word)
    startIndex = s.find(word, start)
    while startIndex != -1:
        intervals.append([startIndex, startIndex+wordLength-1])
        startIndex = s.find(word, startIndex+1)
```



**STEP 2 Merge Interval.**

We want to merge these interval like this [Leetcode56 Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/). Note: You have to be very very familiar with the merge problem/solutions! This is very classic question that you must know!
```python
merged = []
intervals.sort()
print(intervals)
for interval in intervals:
    if not merged or merged[-1][1] + 1 < interval[0]:
        merged.append(interval)
    else:
        merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1],interval[1])
```



**STEP 3 Based on the all the interval, we can append the bold tag correspondly.**
```python
result = ""
prev = 0
for interval in merged:
    result += (s[prev:interval[0]] + "<b>" + s[interval[0]: (interval[1]+1)] + "</b>")
    prev = interval[1]+1
result += s[prev:]
return result
```
Note: do not forget the remaining part of string, which is `result += s[prev:]`. It's also very common thing we need to deal with when we do string traversal.
